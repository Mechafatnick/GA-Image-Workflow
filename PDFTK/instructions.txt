Instructions for PDFTK Builder Enhanced Version 4.1.6 Portable Distribution

1. Download the PdftkBuilder-4.1.6-portable.zip file and extract its contents to the default folder 
or to a folder of your choice.

NOTE: If you have an existing installation of PDFTK Builder and have customized the .ini file, 
(a) extract the .zip file to a different folder or (b) rename, copy, or move your existing 
PdftkBuilder.ini file so it won't be overwritten by the default .ini file and then restore it.

This folder will serve as the PDFTK Builder program folder and should contain the following files:  

	pdftk.exe			(PDFtk Server version 2.0.2 Windows executable, 32-bit)
	libiconv2.dll			(GNU Win32 package to convert between character encodings)	

	PdftkBuilder.exe		(PDFTK Builder Windows executable, 32-bit)		 
	PdftkBuilder.ini		(PDFTK Builder configuration file)

	instructions.txt
	license.txt

	\docs 				(Documents subfolder containing following 9 files)
	  PdftkServer.pdf		(PDFTK Server Reference Manual)
	  PdftkBuilder.pdf		(PDFTK Builder User Guide)
	  PdftkBuilder.html		(PDFTK Builder Help File)
	  pdftkb.png
	  pdftkb_context_menu.png
	  pdftkb_split.png
	  pdftkb_number.png
	  pdftkb_rotate.png
	  pdftkb_compare.png

Click on file PdftkBuilder.exe to launch program.  Note that this file is not code signed and thus
Windows will flag it as risky the first time the program is launched.  As long as the application 
was downloaded directly from its project site on SourceForge, the message can be safely ignored by 
clicking on the ‘More info’ link on the upper left of the first screen and then the ‘Run anyway' 
button at the bottom of the second screen.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEPS 2 & 3 ONLY APPLY IF YOUR DISTRIBUTION CAME WITHOUT A COPY OF .EXE FILE FOR PDFTK SERVER v2.02.  
IF NO .EXE FILE WAS PROVIDED BUT v2.02 IS ALREADY INSTALLED ON YOUR MACHINE, YOU MAY SKIP STEP 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Download the PDFtk Server installer for Windows from: 

	https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/    (see the Windows Download section)

and run it.  The PDFtk executable (pdftk.exe) will be installed in the following folder on a
64-bit Windows machine:

	C:\Program Files (x86)\PDFtk Server\bin\.

3. Copy the file from pdftk.exe the PDFtk Server\bin subfolder:

	C:\Program Files (x86)\PDFtk Server\bin\pdftk.exe
	
to the PDFTK Builder folder (created in step 1).

4. (Optional) Settings (.ini):  Edit the following sections of PdftkBuilder.ini if applicable.
Changing the default settings can be delayed until actually needed as the program will run as-is.

[Numbering]:  For consistency with PDFTK Builder v3, the initial setting of page size is A4 (ISO).
If you use letter (8-1/2x11 in.) pages instead of A4 pages and plan to use the 'Number Pages' option 
on the 'Mark Pages' tab, comment out the PageWidth and PageHeight lines for A4 pages (595x842) and 
un-comment the corresponding lines for letter pages (612x792).

[Applications] If you want to (a) use an app to view (open) .pdf or .txt files other than the one
set by the file association or (b) specify external apps for use with the 'Compare' or 'Launch' 
functions of Tool Set 4, the apps must be installed and then configured in the .ini file.

For further instructions, see file PdftkBuilder.ini and Appendix C of the PDFTK Builder User Guide, 
both of which are accessible from the Help menu of the program.
